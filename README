DESCRIPTION:
philly_mud is a basic Multi-User Dungeon/Dimension/Domain
written in PLT Racket, a dialect of Scheme. It serves as
a test-bed project for me to learn Scheme in a more directed
and meaningful way. I hate how programming tutorials always
show these ridiculous examples that are completely devoid
of context. It's all "foo" this and "bar" that, disconnecting
concept from context. I believe this to be both unnecessary
and foolish.

GOALS:
1. Learn Scheme
2. Bring the MUD form to a new generation
3. Let other people participate in its creation
4. Make something about the things I love about Philadelphia
