philly_mud starts as a basic Multi-User Dungeon/Dimension/Domain
written in PLT Racket, a dialect of Scheme. It served as
a test-bed project for me to learn Scheme in a more directed
and meaningful way. I hate how programming tutorials always
show these ridiculous examples that are completely devoid
of context. It's all "foo" this and "bar" that, disconnecting
concept from context. I believe this to be both unnecessary
and foolish.

I got bored with Scheme and wanted to start learning more about
dynamic web apps. So I ported my existing code from Racket
to Node.JS, a process that took about a whole day on an airplane.
I've been extending it from there, with an emphasis on trying
to use 3rd party libraries for as much as possible.

GOALS:
1. Learn Node.js
2. Bring the MUD form to a new generation
3. Let other people participate in its creation

LINKS:
You can learn more about Node.js here:
	http://nodejs.org/

I'm not going to link you to any particular MUDs. The ones 
I used to play are no longer running, and the ones that are
still running are not very accessible. 

However, I would suggest playing the original Zork:
	http://pot.home.xs4all.nl/infocom/zork1.html

Imagine "now add other people" and that should give you an 
idea of how these sorts of games go.
