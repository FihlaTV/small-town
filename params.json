It is an archaic type of networked game where users connect via primitive networking tools to interact with other users in a world that largely exists only in their imaginations. Text descriptions of interconnected rooms stream over mostly raw network interfaces, manipulated by the barest of protocols, designed first to be human-generatable.\r\n\r\n{a brief history of very early muds}\r\n\r\nIn the year 2014, you don't find many extant examples of the MUD form. Largely supplanted by the MMORPG, modern players lack the patience and background to tolerate the archane interface, slow pace of play, and walls of text as the only level of feedback. Users today want to be shown something they *can't* imagine, experiencing carefully curated rides on XP-points roller coasters. The MUD style is an anachronism of a pre-social Internet, where users were largely equivalent to developers, they bootstrapped their own services, and created much of what we now take for granted as the open culture of free software.\r\n\r\n{my eaely experiences with muds}\r\n\r\n{interesting programming challenges in mud}\r\n\r\nTo make a MUD today is to pay homage to those times. To try to update it for modern audiences, with an eye towards modern understandings of useabilty, is to relive and glorify a significant part of my childhood, a part that was influential in my choice of software development as a career. Perhaps, in recreating the MUD, I can help inspire a new generation of programmers to pick up their own choice of weapons and slash their way to coding mastery.\r\n\r\n````\r\n:> quit\r\n< Are you sure?\r\n:> not really\r\n< I do not understand \"not really\".\r\n````","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
